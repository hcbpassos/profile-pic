# Profile pic
Really. You don't mind it.
I did notice that some services give you the option to select an URL instead of uploading your profile picture. Sometimes I update mine, and if I want it to be equal in every single service, I got to change one by one manually. One rainy day I had this idea: upload my picture in a place where I can select the URL, so even if changing it, the URL would not. Problem solved.
